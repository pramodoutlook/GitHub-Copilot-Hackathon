# Embedded Health Monitoring System

## Problem Statement
Build a wearable device to monitor heart rate and oxygen levels and send alerts during anomalies.

## Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup
- Connect a pulse oximeter (e.g., MAX30100) to a microcontroller.

### 2. Sensor Driver Code
- Use GitHub Copilot to write C++ code for reading heart rate and SpO2 data.

### 3. Anomaly Detection
- Implement logic to detect abnormal heart rates or oxygen levels.

### 4. Alert Mechanism
- Write code to send alerts via Bluetooth or trigger a buzzer when anomalies are detected.

### 5. Validation
- Simulate scenarios to test anomaly detection and alert accuracy.
